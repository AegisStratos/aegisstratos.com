            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="lead">Aegis Stratos was born from the anguish of watching ordinary people in Ukraine live beneath bombardment and fear — families forced underground, towns erased, and lives destroyed simply for wanting to be free.</p>
            <p>We exist to change that — to harness technology and human ingenuity in the defence of the innocent, the vulnerable, and the persecuted. Our mission is simple but profound: to save lives through intelligent flight.</p>
            <p>Aegis Stratos is developing the next generation of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) enhanced by artificial intelligence — designed not for aggression but for protection, rescue, and resilience. Our systems are being engineered to detect threats faster, guide evacuations, deliver emergency supplies, restore communications, and provide the situational awareness that can mean the difference between life and death.</p>
            <p>We believe that technology, when guided by conscience, can defend freedom and preserve humanity. That conviction defines every decision we make, from design and sourcing to recruitment and partnerships.</p>

            <h2>Founded on Purpose</h2>
            <p>When the invasion of Ukraine began, we watched engineers, volunteers, and soldiers improvise with whatever tools they could find. Drone technology proved transformative — yet access to reliable, secure, mission-ready systems was scarce. We realised that a company rooted in ethical AI and disciplined engineering could fill this gap: producing drones specifically built for humanitarian-defence operations.</p>
            <p>Drawing on extensive experience in product engineering leadership and large-scale transformation programmes, we saw how advanced AI and modern engineering practices could be channelled into humanitarian defence. That philosophy now underpins Aegis Stratos.</p>
            <p>Among the first to join were experienced leaders from Swedish Air Force, NATO representation, defence contracting, telecommunications, and defence-industry sales with firms including Saab Aerospace & Defence. Most critically, we secured partnership with a serving member of the Ukrainian military — a recognised leader in Ukraine's drone programme.</p>

            <h2>Partnership & Proof of Purpose</h2>
            <p>Aegis Stratos is an emerging venture built around experienced people, proven leadership, and a partnership that few others possess. Our strength lies in our operational partner in Ukraine — a serving member of the Ukrainian military and a recognised leader in Ukraine's drone-production programme.</p>
            <p>Through this partnership we maintain a direct, trusted link to Ukraine's defence-manufacturing ecosystem, giving us real-time insight into battlefield requirements and immediate access to validated designs and operational feedback. This partnership is a working alliance, not a memorandum of intent: it ensures every design decision we make aligns with real operational need.</p>
            <p>We are a start-up seeking funding to build our first aircraft — to prove capability before claiming scale. Our initial objective is simple and measurable: to design, build, and ship the first generation of humanitarian-defence drones in the UK under Ukrainian guidance and, where appropriate, licence.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">Credibility in defence is earned through action, and our credibility will begin with delivery.</p>
